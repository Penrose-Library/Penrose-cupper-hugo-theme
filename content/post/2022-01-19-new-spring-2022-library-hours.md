We continue to be committed to student learning and are delighted to be able to provide these additional hours.  Please note that the Library's schedule may change in future semesters based upon student and faculty usage data and staffing availability.  

Also, as we are committed to doing our part to keep the Whitman community safe and healthy, please remember that:

* N95, KN95, or KF94 face masks must be worn at all times in the building, INCLUDING all of the study rooms.  Please refer to the [Spring 2022 COVID-19 Protocols](https://www.whitman.edu/covid-dashboard/updates/spring-2022-covid-19-protocols) for more information.
* NO FOOD is permitted within the Library.  If you bring a water bottle, please lower your mask to take a sip and then replace it immediately.

We are grateful for your cooperation, courtesy, and kindness during this stressful time.
