Have you ever brought all your books to the library, only to realize you forgot your laptop? Or maybe you’ve wanted to take study break at Cleve without taking your backpack with you.

Penrose Library now offers Short-term Lockers for all Students, Faculty and Staff for this type of situation. It’s an easy and convenient option to store your things at the library, while you do something else.

If you’re interested, stop by the Circulation Desk to check out a key. Short-term Lockers are located next to the quiet room in the Video Alcove on the 2nd (main) floor. The Lockers check out for 24 hours and can be renewed for an additional 24 hours.

Full details on Short-term and Long-term Lockers can be found on our [FAQ page](https://asklibrarian.whitman.edu/faq/348815).
