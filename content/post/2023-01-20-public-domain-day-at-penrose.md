While Public Domain Day is usually celebrated on January 1st, we're celebrating it on January 27th as an homage to 1927 works entering the public domain this year! 

The public domain refers to works that are no longer under copyright protection, making them freely available for anyone to use and enjoy. This includes classic literature, films, music compositions, and historical documents.

We will have ice cream to celebrate "I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!" entering the public domain, watch films like Metropolis, Sunrise, Wings, and the Jazz Singer, and use materials from our collections, including the archives, to create new works remixed from resources entering the public domain. You'll also be able to learn more about the public domain and how it impacts everyone. This is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to delve deeper into the world of literature, history, and art without worrying about copyright restrictions.

The event will be held on January 27th and will run from 3 to 5 in the Library classroom (CTL/Fishbowl). We hope to see you there!
