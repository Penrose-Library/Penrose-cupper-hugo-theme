Over the summer Penrose Library eliminated charging Overdue Fines for items. Even small fines can be a stressor and we hope that removing them will improve the experience many students, faculty and staff have of using the library.

Combined with automatic renewals from 2022 and longer loan periods from last year, Whitman students, faculty and staff are able to keep items checked out for longer with few hassles. 

Please note, patrons will continue to receive a replacement charge if an item is 20 days past its due date or if they report it as lost, destroyed or damaged beyond repair. However, if the item is returned, the fee is refunded in its entirety and there are no fines for the time the item was overdue.
