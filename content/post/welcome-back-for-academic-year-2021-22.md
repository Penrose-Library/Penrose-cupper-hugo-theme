Welcome back!

We missed you at Penrose and weâ€™re excited to see everyone back this fall. Somethings have changed so read on for more info on those changes.

**What are the hours**?

For this academic year, the library will be open:

Monday-Thursday, 8:30 am-11:00 pm

Friday, 8:30 am-6:00 pm

Saturday, noon-6:00 pm

Sunday, noon-11:00 pm

**Is the whole library open**?

Yes, all 4 floors are open again and you can browse the stacks.

**Can I still request books for pick up?**

Yep! The "request for pickup" button will remain in Sherlock. If the item is on the shelf, you will be directed to the Circulation Desk to checkout and pick-up your book, DVD, etc.

**Has printing changed?**

There are not going to be self-service printers in the library, but Centralized printing is moving to an alcove on the main floor of the library. Printouts will be available for pick-up during normal library open hours. More info to come from WCTS.

**How can I get in touch with a librarian?**

We will still be hosting drop-ins from 9-12, 1-4, but you can also reach us on chat from the library homepage or send in a question on the [Contact a Librarian page](/contact_librarian/).

**Are reserves back?**

Yes! Just go to the circ desk and give your class number.

**Is the archives open?**

The Archives is open for research in the reading room. While appointments are no longer necessary, consultation with archives staff ([archives@whitman.edu](mailto:archives@whitman.edu)) before you come will ensure a more productive experience for you.
