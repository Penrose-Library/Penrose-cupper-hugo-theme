For the summer, we will be open from 9-5, Monday through Friday. We are open to everyone. 

We will be closed after noon on the following dates: July 21, August 11

While we will not have designated reference hours, but librarians will be around while we are open to help with any research needs, the circulation desk can help you find an available librarian.

Study rooms are unlocked and available first come, first serve.
