Please join us for an evening with Mike Caulfield on Thursday, April 25, at 7 p.m. in Olin Auditorium.



Join Penrose Library for an exhilarating discussion with Mike Caulfield, a distinguished research scientist from the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public, where he studies the spread of online rumors and misinformation.

As the creator of the SIFT methodology of source evaluation, Mike Caulfield has empowered thousands of educators and learners to navigate the digital landscape and verify claims and sources. He will discuss his book, written with Sam Wineburg, "Verified: How to Think Straight, Get Duped Less, and Make Better Decisions about What to Believe Online,” followed by an interactive dialogue on how each of us can be information literate and become critical digital citizens. We look forward to having you!

The event is free and open to the public.
