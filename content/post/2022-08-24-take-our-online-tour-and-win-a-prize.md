</span> 

Hello students! Penrose Library would like to welcome you and offer [a short introduction](https://libguides.whitman.edu/intro) to our staff and services. 

We intend for this virtual tour to not take more than a half hour of your time (probably more like 15 minutes!). Please don't hesitate to chat with us in the box on the left of the tour page or contact us if you have any questions. At the end of the page you will see a Google Form, please fill it out and come to the library for a small prize. 5 people will be selected from everyone who has completed the form for a special prize. While everyone is welcome to review the information about the library, the prizes are only open to first-year students.
