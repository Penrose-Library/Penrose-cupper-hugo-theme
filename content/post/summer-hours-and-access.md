Our Summer hours are 9am-5pm, Monday through Friday.

The stacks will remain closed and we will continue porch pick-up and will have to pull books upon request. It is no-longer required to make a reservation to use the library, but it is still only open to students who have received summer access, faculty, and staff.

Hours and access may change as the summer progresses and COVID restrictions lighten, we will announce changes as they come.
