On Sunday, June 26, Sherlock will be unavailable from noon until approximately 7 pm for a scheduled update to the catalog system. There will be a few important changes to the system following this update. We will keep the same four search scopes we have had (Whitman, Summit, Articles, Everything), but the Everything scope will become the default. If you are using Permalinks for items in the catalog, these will not redirect you to the same items in the upgraded system. For example, if you have items in the catalog linked in your Canvas site using a Permalink, you will need to update that link after the system upgrade. Before June 26, if you sign into your library account and then access any saved Permalinks, you can save the individual items to your My Favorites menu in Sherlock; individual saved records will be migrated automatically, and after the update you can obtain the new Permalink from that My Favorites list and update your links. 

We will be monitoring and testing the system in the week following the upgrade. Please be aware that there could be some unusual or unexpected behavior in searching and requesting; we will try to keep this to a minimum and address any issues as soon as possible. Do let us know if you encounter issues or if you have questions.
