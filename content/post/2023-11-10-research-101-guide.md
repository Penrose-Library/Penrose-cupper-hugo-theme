Are you stuck on research? Or feeling overwhelmed? Check out our newly created [Research 101 LibGuide](https://libguides.whitman.edu/c.php?g=1351470)! As a college student, you are not expected to complete a research assignment without assistance. Research can be stressful! In the Research 101 guide, you will find help on how to begin your research and general tips and tricks for navigating the research process. Get guided help with searching, selecting, evaluating, and citing sources. You can also find information about other campus resources.Â

If you need more or prefer one-on-one help, you can [schedule an appointment](https://whitman.libcal.com/appointments) with any of the reference librarians or come to our walk-in hours, Monday-Friday, 9 am - 12 pm and 1 pm - 5 pm. We can help you narrow down a topic, locate sources, develop keywords, and support you through the research process.
