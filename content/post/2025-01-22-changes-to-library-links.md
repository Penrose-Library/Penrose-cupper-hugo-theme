We are making some necessary changes to our library systems that will unfortunately create some (hopefully minor) disruptions in the next few months. We are moving our proxy server, which is the mechanism by which we are able to provide links that ensure off-campus access to our materials. As we transition our proxy servers, there will inevitably be links to library resources that break. 

Links using the old server, which have .ezproxy.whitman.edu in them, will work through January 31, 2025.

We are working to ensure continued access to the best of our ability and have created [a form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdskwEusPqPpCZfH4EB_4NVCUy81qzGQligjCtnSKyWkSWs3w/viewform?usp=sf_link) for you to easily report links that you need fixed. If you have an individual link or a long list or syllabi full of links, please submit them there and we will send you back the new correct link(s) as quickly as possible. If possible please include a citation to help us ensure we are sending the right link.

Thank you for your patience as we upgrade our library systems!
