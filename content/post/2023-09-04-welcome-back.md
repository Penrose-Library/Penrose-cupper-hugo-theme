Welcome back!

**What are the hours**?

The library will be open:

Monday-Thursday, 7:30 am-1:00 am

Friday, 7:30 am-6:00 pm

Saturday, 10:00 am-6:00 pm

Sunday, 10:00 am-1:00 am

**Can I still request books for pick up?**

Yep! The "request for pickup" button is in Sherlock. If the item is on the shelf, you will be directed to the Circulation Desk to checkout and pick-up your book, DVD, etc. You will receive an email when it is available.

**How can I get in touch with a librarian?**

We host drop-in office hours from 9-12, 1-5 or you can make an [appointment](https://whitman.libcal.com/appointments), but you can also reach us on the [Contact a Librarian page](/contact_librarian/).

**Is the archives open?**

The Archives is open for research in the reading room. While appointments are no longer necessary, consultation with archives staff ([archives@whitman.edu](mailto:archives@whitman.edu)) before you come will ensure a more productive experience for you.
