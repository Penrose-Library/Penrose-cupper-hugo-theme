Librarians are here to help you with any aspect of a research project; developing a research question, finding sources, evaluating sources, writing citations, tracking down references, whatever it may be! This doesn't just have to be for papers, but can also be prep for your orals, or even just personal research you are doing outside of school. 

We have drop-in hours in the library on weekdays from 9-12 and 1-5, or you can make an [appointment](https://whitman.libcal.com/appointments) with one of us. You can also contact us by chat (from the library homepage) during our drop-in hours, or [send us an email](https://library.whitman.edu/contact_librarystaff/).
