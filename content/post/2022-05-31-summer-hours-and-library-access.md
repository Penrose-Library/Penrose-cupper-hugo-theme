For the summer, we will be open from 9-5, Monday through Friday. We are open to everyone. Whitman is a fully vaccinated campus; visitors who are not members of the Whitman Community who have registered their vaccine status with the college will have to show proof of vaccination at the circulation desk.

We will be closed on the following holidays: June 20, July 4-5.

We will be closed after noon on the following dates: June 3, July 1, July 22, August 12. 

While we will not have designated reference hours, but librarians will be around while we are open to help with any research needs, the circulation desk can help you find an available librarian.
