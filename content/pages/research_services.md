# Local History Research

For complete information about local history resources, including newspapers, city directories, maps, and census records, see our [Walla Walla and Local History Guide.](https://libguides.whitman.edu/wallawalla)

The Archives houses the Walla Walla *Union-Bulletin* and other local newspapers on microfilm. Microfilm may be used by members of the public from 9am-4pm, Monday through Friday. Depending on the demand, use of the microfilm may be restricted to 30 minute increments.

Whitman students, faculty and staff can access the *Union-Bulletin* between 1945-2017 via [Newspaper Archive.](https://access-newspaperarchive-com.ezproxy.whitman.edu/us/washington/walla-walla/walla-walla-union-bulletin) 
Non-Whitman affiliates can purchase digital access to the *Union-Bulletin* via Newspaper Archive [here](https://wallawallaunionbulletin.newspaperarchive.com/).

# Scanning and Reproductions

Researchers are allowed to reproduce materials using personal cameras or cell phones at the discretion of Archives staff. In compliance with
copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code), any copies must not be “used for any purpose other than private study,
scholarship or research.” By allowing for reproduction, WCNA does not grant permission to publish.

**Fees for Reproductions:** Copies or digital scans may be made by Archives staff for the convenience of the individual user in support of
research and teaching. Fees are waived for Whitman students, staff and faculty. Other fees may be waived at the discretion of the Archivist.

The time and resources required to create photocopies or scans depends on the nature and volume of the request, and the physical condition of
the material. As such, **reproduction requests will be completed at an hourly rate of \$25 per hour, with a minimum charge of \$10.** Select
paper-based material that can be photocopied or scanned in bulk can be done for \$0.10 per page.

Please contact [archives@whitman.edu](mailto:archives@whitamn.edu) for estimates on reproduction fees.

# Permissions to Publish

Researchers wishing to publish, disseminate or display materials from the archives must complete a [Permission to Publish
form](http://works.whitman.edu/archives-application-permission). The Archivist must approve all requests to publish materials from our
collections. 

There are fees associated with requests to publish from our Collections. Payments may only be made by cash or check made out to Whitman College Archives.
