Penrose Library has been consistently highly ranked by the Princeton Review. The libraryâ€™s digital environment, with more than 85,000 unique journal titles, 210 databases, 376,000 eBooks and 45,000 streaming videos, complements its more than 500,000-volume print collection. Penrose Library has generous open hours, often available 24 hours a day to the Whitman Community, and the facility itself was built to facilitate inquiry, study, and learning. Whitman College and Northwest Archives include 4,800 linear feet of archival and manuscript material and over 5,000 rare books.
