# Class Sessions in the Archives

Faculty are encouraged to incorporate materials from the Archives into
their teaching. There are multiple, scalable options for curricular use
of collections and the Archivists are available to work with you to
achieve your pedagogical goals. These include:

-   A single class visit to the archives to orient students to the
    collections and space
-   A thematic visit to the archives, with selections on a particular
    topic, subject, or theme
-   An assignment designed around collections that requires out-of-class
    student visits to the archives
-   An entire class or syllabus built around archival collections

In all these scenarios, our instruction focuses both on enabling
students to find and use collections, and developing their skills in
analyzing and interpreting primary sources. If you are interested in
exploring any of these options, email Ben Murphy
([murphybp@whitman.edu](mailto:murphybp@whitman.edu)).
