## DEIA Statement

Penrose Library supports Whitman College's [Diversity Statement](https://www.whitman.edu//about/policies-and-statements), statements from the American Library Association on [Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion](https://www.ala.org/advocacy/ala-and-affiliate%C2%A0equity-diversity-and-inclusion-statements), and Society of American Archivists' [Statement on Diversity Equity and Inclusion](https://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-statement-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion). Furthermore, we stand in solidarity with colleagues from [BCALA](https://www.bcala.org/press-release-bcala-statement-to-ala-council-against-racism), [APALA](https://www.apalaweb.org/apala-statement-against-racism-and-harassment/), and [REFORMA](https://www.reforma.org/bcalasolidarity) who have articulated critiques and extensions of these statements. The prejudices, injustices, oppression, and violence that arise from racism do not belong here. As a library, we affirm that information is power; that equity, diversity, and inclusion make our institution stronger; and that individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives enrich our environment. We acknowledge that the library and archival professions remain predominantly white, and because of this uncomfortable truth, we aim to identify and challenge racism and white supremacy, while striving towards supporting diversity in our fields. We acknowledge that these efforts are ongoing, continuous, and inform all aspects of our work.

Because we acknowledge these realities, we strive to amplify voices of diversity within our collections, and also aspire to champion equity by identifying and building out areas in which our collections are lacking, and thereby enrich the educational goals of the College. We aim to provide equitable access to our collections, programs, and services independent of gender identity, sexuality, race, ethnicity, national origin, socioeconomic class, disability, religion, spirituality, and age cohort. We seek to improve equity, diversity, and inclusion within the library, and are committed to partnering with communities on-campus and elsewhere who share these goals. We are advocates of freedom of expression and welcome conversations from library patrons and colleagues; we do not tolerate hate speech. We invite dialogue, encourage research, and support educational initiatives that align with these objectives. 

Please consult our [DEIA Actions](/deiaactions) page for more information.

## Gifts to Penrose Library

Gifts to Penrose Library are very welcomed and valued. Through the generous support of friends and alumni, donations to the Library have helped build outstanding collections. Gifts, often those that memorialize or honor loved ones, continue to help foster the traditions of scholarship, critical thinking, and lifelong learning that are hallmarks of a Whitman education. Modest gifts are very much appreciated, as are bequests, endowments and larger contributions.

The collections at Penrose are carefully selected to provide balanced, vibrant and timely materials that serve to support the curricular and research needs of our faculty and students. In order to safeguard quality, consistency, and relevance to the needs of the College, donated materials are reviewed using these same [criteria in our collection development policy](http://works.whitman.edu/collectiondevelopmentpolicy). Moreover, due to space, staffing, and resource limitations, we are unable to accept all gifts of materials.

### General Policy

Gifts-in-kind, especially library materials, are accepted with the understanding that they become the property of Whitman College. Penrose Library retains the right to decline, retain, or dispose of the materials at its discretion. Only the Library Director, Collection Management Librarian, or Archivist/Special Collections Librarian may accept in-kind donations on behalf of the Library. A signed Gift of Property statement must accompany all such donations.

[General Library Materials Gift Form](http://works.whitman.edu/giftform)

[Special Collections Materials Gift Form](http://works.whitman.edu/archivesgiftform)

### Guidelines

#### General Library Materials

We welcome books and media appropriate for the general library collections if they support the College’s curriculum and faculty research needs. The Library does not accept duplicates of held materials, textbooks, outdated or materials in poor condition, mass-market paperback books, general interest magazines, cassette tapes, software, photocopied materials, vanity press books, popular pamphlets or promotional materials. Only commercially produced DVDs in like-new condition will be accepted.

Before bringing gifts of 25 volumes or more to the Library, please contact Roger Stelk, Head of Collection Management (509-527-5909 or [stelkre@whitman.edu](stelkre@whitman.edu)) to discuss the potential donation. He may also be able to suggest other resources if the potential gift is deemed not appropriate for Penrose Library. Donations are boxed and delivered at the owner’s expense.

#### Special Collections Materials

Gifts of manuscript collections, rare books, and unique materials, especially those that pertain to Whitman College and northwest regional history, are encouraged. Before such items or materials are donated to the Whitman College and Northwest Archives, please consult with Alexis Hickey, Archivist and Special Collections Librarian (509-526-4731 or [hickeya@whitman.edu](hickeya@whitman.edu)). The Development Office encourages donors to consider providing financial support for the processing and preservation of such donated materials, especially if the collection is of substantial size and/or significance.

#### Appraisals

Donors are responsible for obtaining an appraisal and consulting with a tax advisor in order to obtain such information. Generally, gifts with a declared value over $5,000 will require an independent qualified appraisal; those with a declared value over $500 will require that the donor file IRS Tax Form 8283. Please read IRS publications 526 and 561 for more information.

Appraisers may be located through the [American Society of Appraisers](https://www.appraisers.org/), the [Antiquarian Booksellers Association](http://www.abaa.org/), or the [Appraisers’ Association of America](http://appraisersassociation.org/). If you wish to have an appraisal conducted, please do so before donating the materials to Whitman College’s Penrose Library.

All gifts will be acknowledged by letter with a count of the donated items. The Library does not provide a detailed, title-by-title listing.

#### Access Restrictions

Generally, gifts for which the donor places restrictions on access are not accepted. Exceptions may be made, for a limited time, for certain sensitive materials donated to Whitman College and Northwest Archives. Penrose Library abides by the American Library Association/Society of American Archivists’ 1994 [Joint Statement on Access to Original Research Materials](http://www2.archivists.org/statements/ala-saa-joint-statement-of-access-guidelines-for-access-to-original-research-materials-au).

Donated items that Whitman College’s Penrose Library retains are cataloged and listed in the Library’s catalog. Access to other materials will be governed by established library policies. Materials added to the general collections are interfiled with like books on the same subject. Separately named collections are not maintained.

#### Financial Support

Monetary gifts, especially those that would enable the purchase of new materials, the delivery of innovative services, additional furnishings, technology enhancements, or the support of special program areas are actively encouraged. Please contact Ping Fu, Library Director (509-527-5193 or [fup@whitman.edu](fup@whitman.edu)) or Steve Setchell, Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations (509-527-5979 or [setchesj@whitman.edu](setchesj@whitman.edu)) for more information.

Please contact Ping Fu, Library Director (509-527-5193 or [fup@whitman.edu](fup@whitman.edu)) if you have any questions or wish to discuss a specific donation.

### Circulation and Access Policies

* The willful removal of a book or other Library property in contravention to Library regulations
* The intentional alteration or destruction of library ownership records

Engaging in inappropriate use of materials will jeopardize library borrowing privileges.

### Materials Challenge Policy

Censorship of the library’s collections will not be tolerated. As a college library, we cultivate a collection of resources and develop displays that are appropriate for the curriculum at Whitman College and an adult audience. Our collection represents various viewpoints that stimulate intellectual inquiry and foster spirited debate. That said, legitimate complaints about library materials or displays will be reviewed based upon the guidelines endorsed by the American Library Association and their [Intellectual Freedom Manual, 9th ed.](https://sherlock.whitman.edu/permalink/f/19gob7d/CP71230442910001451)

Complaints about materials, not including those held in the Whitman College and Northwest Archives or those externally licensed by the library, will be handled on a case-by-case basis and can only be made by current Whitman students, faculty, and staff. Penrose Library has delegated the responsibility for the selection and evaluation of materials to its librarians. Should a member of the Whitman community think that certain material is unsuitable for the library’s collection or display, the first step is to discuss their concerns with the Head of Collection Management (Roger Stelk, stelkre@whitman.edu) and/or the  Library Director (Ping Fu, [fup@whitman.edu](fup@whitman.edu)).

If the issue is not resolved following an informal discussion about the mission of the library and how the material or display supports learning within the higher education environment, the library has established a formal reconsideration procedure to address concerns about those resources. The process includes:

* Completion of the Request for Reconsideration of Library Resources form by the person bringing the complaint;
* Based upon the [Penrose Library Collection Development Policy](http://works.whitman.edu/collectiondevelopmentpolicy), the Request for Reconsideration will be reviewed by the Library’s Collection Management Team. The Team will develop a recommendation for the Library Advisory Committee;
* Review of the Request for Reconsideration and the Collection Management Team’s recommendation by the Library Advisory Committee. This may include an interview with the requestor;
* Determination of the status of the material by the Committee that is conveyed to the requestor in a timely manner.

Penrose Library is committed to providing resources that support the work of our students, faculty, and staff. All requests for reconsideration are taken seriously and will be evaluated in a fair and thorough manner.

## Penrose Library Exhibits and Display Policy

#### Purpose

Library exhibits are an opportunity for outreach and a way to convey our interest in encouraging intellectual curiosity and learning. By showcasing library collections and engaging with other campus communities, Penrose’s exhibits are intended to share narratives about ideas, places, and movements. Exhibits illustrate complex questions and help us to understand our place in the world, challenge us to think broadly, and start conversations across boundaries.

#### Content

Including materials from library collections and archives in the exhibition is strongly encouraged. In principle, exhibitions should be relevant to Penrose Library, its collection or services. Proposals will be considered on broad appeal, educational content, and appropriateness of subject, technique, and style for the intended location and audience. Penrose Library reserves the right to deny proposals it deems do not fit with the library’s mission.

#### Approval and Requesting

Any member of the Whitman community may submit an [Exhibit Proposal form](http://works.whitman.edu/exhibitproposal) for exhibits or displays and the Library can help when developing a proposal. Displays are temporary in nature and will last according to the approved dates on the proposal form.

Exhibit and display space is managed by the Penrose Library User Services and Outreach Team, which will respond to proposals. Proposals should be submitted at least two weeks (two months for archival exhibits) in advance of the exhibit opening date, and proposals will be responded to within one week. Penrose Library will not exert editorial control over the exhibition but may provide feedback according to standard best practices. Curators are solely responsible for content creation. The Library has final approval for the layout of the exhibit, exhibit duration, and placement of exhibit. Exhibits by library staff need not be approved, but staff should still fill out an [Exhibit Proposal form](http://works.whitman.edu/exhibitproposal) for the purposes of scheduling.

The Library reserves the right to remove or shut down an exhibit that is not in compliance with safety or ADA guidelines, or endangers patrons in any way. The Library will follow a process for reconsideration when concerns are raised about exhibit content.

#### Guidelines

Once an exhibit has been approved, the curator will be contacted by an assigned exhibit supervisor. The supervisor will coordinate including materials from library and archival collections for display and guide installation and removal of the exhibit but the curator is responsible for installation and take down of exhibits.

Library reference service is available to curators, as to all other library users, for guidance in the location of relevant library materials, assistance in preparation of exhibit-related bibliographies, and consultation on exhibit technique.

Written components must be readable. The individual, organization, or group sponsoring and curating the exhibit must be visibly and prominently shown in the exhibit. Library materials must be displayed in an archival correct manner, i.e., they must suffer no damage nor be altered in any way by being placed on exhibit. Proper handling and display of archival material must be approved by Archives staff. If damage does occur to library materials, the Library may seek monetary damages and may affect a person’s or group’s future ability to create exhibits at Penrose.

Exhibits are often located in high traffic areas whose visibility reduces the likelihood of damage or theft of materials; however, the Library takes no responsibility for the security or welfare of non-library materials used in exhibits at any time, including during transport, installation, or dismantling.

#### Supplies/Equipment

Supplies

* Limited supplies are available (tacks, stands, cradles, support for materials, mylar). Any other costs incurred for the exhibits are to be the sole responsibility of the curator.

Exhibit Areas/Cases Available

* 2nd floor short stacks, next to the circulation desk. Open display area, no cases or locks.
* Vitrine (2): 61” Length x 36” Height x 24.5” Depth
  Movable. Can only be on the main floor. Library staff will position them for curators in designated areas.
* Stairwell cases (2): 29” L x 55” H x 16” D
* 1st floor case at bottom of stairwell (1): 45” L x 56” H x 21” D
* 2nd and 3rd floor large cases (2): 163” L x 56” H x 20.5” D
* 2nd floor has power. No audio available.

The built-in cases have slots for glass shelves. More shelves and brackets available. 2nd floor case has slots for shelves behind felt.

Note: the Maxey Museum has priority for the use of the large 3rd floor case.

#### Request for Reconsideration

As a college library, we cultivate a collection of resources and develop displays that are appropriate for the curriculum at Whitman College and an adult audience.

The Library subscribes to the [American Library Association’s Library Bill of Rights](https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/) as it applies to exhibit spaces, specifically:

* The library should not censor or remove an exhibit because some members of the community may disagree with its content. Those who object to the content of any exhibit held at the library should be able to submit their complaint and/or their own exhibit proposal to be judged according to the policies established by the library.
* Challenges of an exhibit can only be made by current Whitman students, faculty, and staff. Should a member of the Whitman community wish to make a complaint, the first step is to discuss their concerns with the College Librarian. If the complaint is regarding disagreement of exhibit content the College Librarian may decide to inform the exhibit curator of the complaint and facilitate a discussion between the parties. If the complaint concerns library materials, the library will follow the Materials Challenge Policy.
* If the issue is not resolved following an informal discussion about the mission of the library and how the material or exhibit supports learning within the higher education environment, the library invites requesters to submit a proposal for their own exhibit.
* Library staff involved in organizing, curating, and/or installing exhibits or displays are deemed to be acting within the course of official duties and under the authority of Penrose Library. Disputes over content, material use, or preservation of staff-led exhibits will be handled internally and not through the reconsideration process.

Endorsed by the Library Advisory Committee, 30 January 2020.
